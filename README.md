# Binary Search Trees in JavaScript

Balanced binary search tree (BST) implementation in JavaScript as part of The Odin Project curriculum. It provides various functions for building, modifying, and analyzing the tree.

## Methods

- `buildTree`: Builds a balanced binary search tree with a given array of numbers.
- `insert(value)`: Inserts a new node with the given value into the binary search tree.
- `delete(value)`: Deletes a node with the given value from the binary search tree.
- `find(value)`: Finds and returns a node with the given value in the binary search tree.
- `levelOrder()`: Traverses the tree in level order and returns an array of values.
- `preOrder()`: Traverses the tree in preorder and returns an array of values.
- `inOrder()`: Traverses the tree in inorder and returns an array of values.
- `postOrder()`: Traverses the tree in postorder and returns an array of values.
- `height(value)`: Calculates the height of a node with the given value in the tree.
- `depth(value)`: Calculates the depth of a node with the given value in the tree.
- `isBalanced()`: Checks if the binary search tree is balanced, ensuring the difference between heights of left and right subtrees is not more than 1.
- `reBalance()`: Rebalances the binary search tree to ensure it maintains a balanced structure.
- `prettyPrint(node)`: Prints a visual representation of the binary search tree.
